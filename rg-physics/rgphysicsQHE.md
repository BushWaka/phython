Quantum spin hall

* time reversal invariant = no B field
* classification of electronic states using toplogy: TKNN
* usually, Hall conductivity violates T, so TKNN integer mush vanish in T invariant system, nonetheless, the observe QSH

They use the usual tight-binding Haldene model

* edge state: surface state caused by boundary with another phase (vacuum). responsible for the conductivity of the sample

Questions:
1. what does the state qualitatively look like?
