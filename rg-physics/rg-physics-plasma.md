#Motivation
* Plasma is extremely hot so you can't use convential wall to trap them. Luckily, magnetic field exists in nature. (actually, I'm still confused. According to Earnshaw theorem you can't simply create a stable equilibrium in EM with static field alone)
* How do they prepare the plasma?
* Sam mentioned that eventually if you wait long enough, the plasma will compress themselves, which will increase the pressure at the core of the plasma until fusion happens. Fusion is one of the main reason why the compression doesn't happen all the time.

#MHD equilibrium
The MHD equilibrium equation is lowest order approximation in modelling our plasma. It means the plasma is in hydrodynamics equilibrium.
I think the equilibrium is stable http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_oscillation, but I'm not sure.

But we know that in real life it is much more complicated because there is velocity distribution across the plasma particles (not necessarily in maxwell-boltzmann distribution).

Ahnd so the system can be very delicate.

Next we add fluctuation in velocities: new phenomena e.g. kink modes arise

#kink modes
I think it is much easier to see this picture if you want to know what 'kink mode' really means http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/Kink_instability_at_Aldermaston.jpg
* From Sam http://home.physics.ucla.edu/calendar/conferences/cmpd/talks/cowley.pdf. Lots of useful visualizations.
* convention for toroidal and poloidal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_and_poloidal.
* convention for the density wave excitation in plasma (sound wave): n is wavenumber for toroidal, m for poloidal
* the Zakharov paper says kink mode excitation with n=1 is usually the most unstable one.
 I haven't figured out why this is the case, but maybe because lower mode has higher amplitude (fix me).
* Are m and n excitation independent of each other?
* difference between 'twist' and radial oscillation in m excitation. the argument applies to the n excitation. The twist basically means the m wave travels along the the poloidal
* "nonabelian plasma".  probably only exists in quark gluon plasma, because QGP has more internal structure, which allows you to have a richer gauge structure. (actually, if you're interested, I've seen an example where you can implement nonabelian gauge symmetry in the usual quantum mechanics system. all you need is a hydrogen atom with degeneracies, maybe)
* Does the discontinuity caused by kink modes travel or oscillate or both (I think it's both)

#Eddy currents and Hiro currents
One of the main goal of the plasma confinement modelling is to explain kink modes.
The current model only use eddy current as the main source of kink mode.
This paper claims that it is not sufficient, and that we need to include Hiro currents in order to realistically model our plasma.
WTKM current is basically one of the theoretical model used to explain Hiro current -> "galvanize" contact with the confinement wall

#Sideway forces
NO idea yet, I missed the discussion
